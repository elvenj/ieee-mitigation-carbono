Global warming is the principle explanation behind the temperature increase on the planet. As one of the maj or greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide has a strong influence on the global warming. Fossil fuel-based power generation is one of the primary source that release carbon dioxide to the environment. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is an emerging global technology to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel power generation plants. However, this technology is highly capital and resource intensive and those vary from country to country as well. Therefore, it is essential to estimate the economic feasibility and the impacts on the environmental resources beforehand. This study is an effort to estimate the technical and economic feasibility of implementing CCS technology in the Sri Lankan fossil fuel power plants.","","978-1-6654-1712-9","10.1109/EECon52960.2021.9580880","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9580880","carbon dioxide;carbon capture and storage;fossil fuel power plants;environmental resources","Costs;Greenhouse effect;Transportation;Global warming;Fossil fuels;Water pollution;Carbon capture and storage","","","","13","IEEE","3 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper involves the minimization of the total cost of power generation from thermal plants in the Western Operating Area of Saudi Electricity Company, incorporating the environmental constraints and the transmission line losses. Economic Dispatch is one of the most important function that is performed in a power system control center so as to minimize the oil consumption in thermal power plants and thus decrease the power generation cost. As the power generation process in thermal power plants causes the emission of significant amount of harmful gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), and oxide of nitrogen (NOx), it is important to minimize the emission of these gases by appropriate allocation of the total power demand among the various power plants in the system on a continuous basis. Hence this paper focusses on the minimization of the fuel cost of the thermal power plants subjected to these emission constraints. The gradient descent technique based on Lagrange multiplier method is utilized in this environmental economic dispatch of the thermal power plants. Investigations are carried out with the daily hourly load curve corresponding to three days, each one covering three different seasons: summer, winter and Hajj. The investigations reveal that a considerable reduction in the emission of gases can be achieved with the implementation of the environmental economic dispatch function in the area load dispatch center.","","978-1-7281-0145-3","10.1109/IASEC.2019.8686538","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8686538","Economic Dispatch;Environmental Dispatch;Thermal power Plants;Carbon Dioxide Emission;Nitrogen Oxides Emission","Power generation;Fuels;Environmental economics;Thermal loading;Nitrogen","","1","","15","IEEE","11 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The power industry must fulfill its carbon emission reduction obligations as soon as possible. Thermal power plants are the main source of carbon emissions in the power industry, so finding out the key influencing factors of thermal-power-plant carbon emission and making accurate predictions are important measures to promote the low-carbon development of the power industry. Although some precise models have been proposed, most power plants cannot obtain all the parameters required by the precise models in the actual production practice, which limits their application. Machine learning technology accepts numerical data as input and establishes the mapping relationship between variables automatically, which results in loose requirements on data. This paper summarizes several key influencing factors of carbon dioxide emissions of thermal power plants that are easy to observe and establishes a prediction model of carbon dioxide emissions of thermal power plants based on eXtreme Gradient Boosting.

In 2021, the first performance period of the power generation industry in the national carbon market was officially launched, and the thermal power industry is the only emission control industry in the national carbon market. Under the background of the current dual carbon revolution, emission control requirements are gradually increased, and the impact on the economic efficiency of thermal power plants is further amplified by whether low-carbon operation can be realized. However, due to the impact of technology and other objective factors, the carbon emission intensity of thermal power units is affected by the unit characteristics, fuel, load rate and other factors, and there are many factors affecting the carbon emission level of thermal power plants. Therefore, how to achieve reasonable control of thermal power plant carbon emissions under given conditions becomes an important factor affecting the economics of thermal power plants. Since various operational control quantities of thermal power plants, such as power supply and heat supply, are closely related to carbon emissions, it is effective to construct a cause-effect diagram to fit the relationship between operational control quantities and carbon emissions based on data-driven cause-effect inference, and to perform sensitivity analysis on carbon emission levels to achieve reasonable control of carbon emissions for low-carbon operation of thermal power plants. In this paper, we present a data-driven causal inference method for low-carbon operation of thermal power plants. The causal diagram is constructed through a priori knowledge, and the relationship equation between the intervening variables and the outcome variables is fitted based on the matching model, and the sensitivity analysis of the unit carbon emissions is carried out to realize the auxiliary decision-making for low-carbon operation of thermal power plants.","","979-8-3503-4509-4","10.1109/EI259745.2023.10512665","State Grid Science and Technology Project(grant numbers:5100-202134560A-0-5-SF); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10512665","causal inference;causal diagram;general propensity score matching;thermal power plant;low carbon operation","Economics;Sensitivity analysis;Power supplies;Decision making;Carbon dioxide;Thermal conductivity;Mathematical models","","","","16","IEEE","9 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many related emission reduction policies have emerged as a response to the special time. The carbon allowance system is one of them; the proposal of the “double carbon goal” (Carbon peak, carbon neutrality) is also an important test for Chinese traditional energy companies, and has brought a series of development problems to them. As a major part of the social energy industry, in China, power industry emits half amount of carbon dioxide each year. Therefore, the carbon emissions of the power industry have received great attention. Because coal power generation has the characteristics of high pollution and high energy consumption, the emission reduction of coal power companies is also one of the main positions for the power industry to achieve the “double carbon goal”. The carbon allowance system has brought considerable challenges to the operation and development of thermal power companies. Thermal power companies must make full use of the market to optimize resource allocation and reduce operating costs. At the same time, they also need to transform the external pressure brought by the carbon allowance system into high-quality development, and actively seek the transformation of power generation emission reduction technology.

The existing work of decarbonization pathway designing usually models electric vehicles (EVs) as the energy consumption sector, and thus underestimates the economic and climate benefits of transportation electrification. Therefore, this work evaluates the potential of V2G including cost and carbon emission reduction through a comprehensive investment and operational model. The influence of V2G is revealed on different power system sectors including generation, transmission, storage and demand. The carbon emission of newly installed capacity and carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) are taken into account. Results show that V2G could profoundly reduce the unit decarbonization cost compared with the disorderly charging mode, through declining energy storage requirement, renewable curtailment, and thermal power reserve. Results also indicate that V2G could expand the reduction of the unit decarbonization cost by 29.6% in the high carbon tax scenario, indicating that V2G will play a greater role under more radical carbon emission reduction and renewable consumption policies.","","979-8-3503-0963-8","10.1109/ACPEE60788.2024.10532423","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10532423","vehicle to grid (V2G);carbon neutrality;electric vehicles;power system transition;decarbonization cost","Vehicle-to-grid;Renewable energy sources;Costs;Biological system modeling;Low-carbon economy;Carbon neutral;Carbon capture and storage","","","","28","IEEE","24 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If Iran wants to fulfill its commitments under an assumed national mitigation target, it needs to reduce its emissions by $30 \%$ by 2040. In this regard, the supply system modeling was performed under two scenarios, Business as Usual and Low-Carbon scenarios, with the OSeMOSYS tool. The research results in the Low-Carbon scenario suggest that the capacities of wind power plants, thermal solar power plants, and photovoltaic power plants need to increase to $10,10.59$, and 55.63 GW by 2040, respectively.

On the other hand, it is also the responsibility of China as a responsible major country to fulfill its international responsibilities and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. The power industry is a pillar industry of the national economy and a key carbon emission industry. At present, thermal power generation is still the most important method of power generation in China, and the peaking of carbon in the thermal power generation industry plays an important role in achieving the goal of carbon peaking in China. In order to achieve the goal of “30$\cdot$60 carbon peak carbon neutrality” in the thermal power industry, the development status of thermal power generation technology, future development trends and carbon capture are considered, and the high-efficiency and flexible coal-fired power generation technology, efficient and flexible gas-fired power generation technology, and coupling renewable energy thermal power generation technology, coal-biomass blended combustion power generation technology, and carbon capture and application technology have been investigated in the paper, which points out the direction for the low-carbon development of the thermal power industry. Generally speaking, China’s thermal power generation technology has reached the world’s advanced level. However, there is still a need to study high-efficiency and low-carbon thermal power generation technologies. In terms of low-carbon applications and technologies for thermal power, the focus should be on high-efficiency thermal power technology and peak shaving technology.

In addition, the thermal power plants adopt advanced peak-shaving technology to increase the depth and speed of peak-shaving in order to absorb more low-carbon electricity such as renewable energy. For natural gas power plants, carbon intake can be reduced from the source through hydrogen-blended combustion. Carbon emissions in the thermal power industry are inevitable.

While direct emissions from connected generators can be measured using power generation data, heat rates, and fuel types, indirect emissions from imported/exported power require AI algorithms analyzing historical and real-time data. CEF of an element is the amount of CO2 generated from power sources for the corresponding element. Our methodology computes the total (both direct and indirect) and Locational Marginal Emission (LME) for diverse energy mixes at each node and load in the power network. This approach provides precise, location specific CEF data, allowing identification of nodes with varying carbon intensity.

It is the purpose of this paper to investigate the reduction of renewable generation curtailments via employment of PtH units. Candidate wind farms and PtH units are applied to the modified IEEE 24-bus power system in a 15-year planning scope with an annual load rise of $\% 2$. The MILP problem is solved in GAMS software via Gurobi solver and four cases are taken into account based on the hydrogen bid variations and the curtailment penalty changes. It is observed that without utilizing PtH units, there are large amounts of wind power curtailments. However, in the presence of PtH units, the annual curtailments are decreased significantly. Moreover, both the hydrogen bid as well as the curtailment penalty effect the curtailment reduction of renewable-based generations.

Firstly, the photovoltaic (PV) source is introduced into the traffic-grid coupling network model, and the weight calculation method for “source-network-pile” is proposed. Then, a charging strategy for EV considering charging time, carbon emission, charging cost, operating state of coupling network and PV output is proposed.

Furthermore, the abovementioned model is applied in the islanded dc microgrid, and the adaptive coordination control strategy among photovoltaic (PV) generator, storage battery, MGU and local load is introduced based on dc bus voltage value. When in charging situation, the dc bus voltage will grow with the increase of the state-of-charge (SoC) of the battery, and the power consumption of MGU can adaptively increase with the increase of dc bus voltage. Because the much input power of MGU will produce hydrogen gas and suppress the activity of methanogens. Hence, the PV generator needs to limit its output power if the battery and MGU all work at their critical point.

With the aim of removing the greenhouse gas CO2, the technology of carbon capture and storage of carbon dioxide CCS (carbon capture storage) from the emissions of thermal power plants (TPP) is spreading around the world. However, there is no commercial interest in CO2 disposal and CCS is not developing fast enough. More than 30,000 Mt. of emissions are made in the world annually. But actually caught by CCS technology about 40 Mt. CCS technology involves costly processes, including drilling wells in the right place to great depths. A large-scale process of converting CO2 into fuel (methanol) with the possibility of generating electricity may turn out to be less costly and more efficient. An additional incentive to expand the ways of utilizing CO2 can be the choice of the same fuel as a means of long-term accumulation of excess electricity in renewable energy sources. A favorable condition for such a decision is the territorial proximity of thermal power plants or industrial enterprises that burn hydrocarbons.

Under the background of large-scale development of renewable energy, high-voltage DC (HVDC) and ultra-high voltage DC (UHVDC)transmission become more effective way to transmit the resources of renewable energy from rich areas such as northwest and southwest to economically developed areas such as North China and East China. It is an important means of realizing the optimal allocation of resources through long-distance power transmission. This paper proposes an optimal power allocation scheme for DC transmission lines, which takes the minimum grid power as the objective function, focusing on the constraints such as the proportion of renewable energy and power constraint rate. The scheme adds the calculation method of economic analysis and carbon emission level, which gives a better understanding for result selection. Finally, a case study is performed by using the proposed optimal power allocation scheme. Taking the typical daily output as an example, it can be seen that the scheme not only meets the load demand, but also improves the consumption level of renewable energy.","","978-1-6654-1104-2","10.1109/CIEEC54735.2022.9846354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9846354","HVDC;Power allocation;Carbon peak;Carbon neutralization;Clean energy","Renewable energy sources;Analytical models;Power transmission lines;Carbon dioxide;Voltage;Wind power generation;Linear programming","","1","","7","IEEE","11 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Under the background, the flexibility and stability of thermal power are particularly prominent because wind power and photovoltaic have high uncertainty. However, carbon emissions from thermal power generation have always been at high levels in the past, which puts great pressure on power systems to reduce carbon emissions. Therefore, this paper proposes a model of coordinated planning and profit distribution of wind, solar and thermal power considering the low-carbon transformation of thermal power. Shapley value method is used to distribute profits, the piecewise linearization strategy is used to solve the model, and core theory is used to verify the existence of cooperative games. The proposed method is applied to an example to verify the effectiveness. The profits of various market players can be guaranteed, and the low-carbon transformation strategy of thermal power units can reduce the overall carbon emissions of the power system while ensuring economic efficiency.","","978-1-6654-7084-1","10.1109/ACFPE56003.2022.9952247","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9952247","Coordinated planning;profit distribution;low carbon transformation;renewable energy consumption;cooperative game","Uncertainty;Carbon dioxide;Games;Optimal scheduling;Power system stability;Wind power generation;Stability analysis","","2","","17","IEEE","29 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

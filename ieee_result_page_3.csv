Due to the variable nature of these sources, new challenges have arisen in the daily operation of power systems. To cover these challenges, it is essential to increase the flexibility of power systems. Electrical vehicle parking lots (EVPLs) and demand response (DR) are introduced as two important solutions to provide a more flexible power system. To this end, this paper proposes a transmission constrained unit commitment based on AC power flow model (AC-TCUC) to minimize the daily cost of the integrated power system with EVPL, incentive-based DR and wind power. Additionally, an information gap decision theory (IGDT)-based robust approach is applied to handle the uncertainty of wind power production as a bi-level optimization problem with no need for probability distribution function (PDF). Numerical results illustrate the impact of EVPL and DR technologies on system operation cost reduction and the uncertainty of wind power.","2572-6927","978-1-7281-5894-5","10.1109/SGC49328.2019.9056584","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9056584","Electric vehicles parking lot;demand response program;renewable energy resource;robust optimization;information gap decision theory","","","","","14","IEEE","6 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, coal and oil account for 64% of electricity production in Reunion Island. In order to break this dependence, this study aims to analyse the integration of renewable energies into the electricity system and in parallel to study the economic and environmental efficiency of the proposed scenario using the LEAP energy modelling tool and the OSeMOSYS optimization model. In this work, two scenarios were developed. The business as usual (BAU) scenario refers to the trend scenario based on the import of conventional fuel. Whereas, the biomass scenario favours electricity self-sufficiency in 2030 by replacing coal and oil with local biomass and waste. Results show that by setting intermittent production at 30%, electrical autonomy in 2030 can be achieved through high levels of production from biomass and waste, which will represent 57.61% of total electricity production. Moreover, the biomass-based scenario has a low production cost and a low greenhouse gas (GHG) emission rate compared to BAU scenario. The integration of biomass and waste into the electricity system leads to a 91% and 91.6% reduction in the cost of electricity and GHG emission respectively in 2030.","2688-2558","979-8-3503-3321-3","10.1109/EFEA56675.2022.10063740","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10063740","Long-term energy planning;energy selfsufficiency;renewable energy;LEAP;Reunion Island;Biomass gasification","Analytical models;Costs;Oils;Biological system modeling;Production;Coal;Wind power generation","","1","","33","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the power ramp rate of the grid is limited due to the higher mechanical time constant of the alternators. Higher power ramp rates lead to grid side instability and may deprive the load of getting continuous power. Moreover, from a microgrid perspective, due to the power generation profile of solar-based RES, the power demand from the grid is highly reduced during daytime peaks and increased with high ramp rates during the evening peaks leading to the formation of a duck curve, which economically affects the power generation companies. To reduce the effect of intermittency of the RES on the grid, to flatten the duck curve and reduce the peak demand from the grid during increased load demands, this paper presents an advanced ramp rate-limit (ARRL) control with battery energy storage (BES) for a grid-tied rooftop solar photovoltaic array (SPVA) based microgrid. The control utilizes the power leveling feature of the BES to ensure continuity of power supply to the loads during RES intermittency or high load demand conditions. This paper also presents a modified adaptive third-order interweaved generalized integrator (MATOIGI) based control to enhance the power quality of the microgrid during distortions/unbalance in grid voltages or load currents and to ensure that the MG performance is not deteriorated as per the IEEE std. 1547.","","978-1-6654-9365-9","10.1109/GlobConPT57482.2022.9938346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9938346","Solar Photovoltaic Array;Power Leveling;Battery;Peak Demand;Evening Peaks;Duck Curve Mitigation;Microgrid;Ramp Rate Limit;MATOIGI-FLL;Power Quality","Photovoltaic systems;Economics;Renewable energy sources;Power demand;Power quality;Microgrids;IEEE Standards","","","","19","IEEE","14 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As ESSs are addressed as an effective tool to mitigate variability and uncertainty of renewable resources, measurements of their values are more emphasized. This paper examines benefits of ESSs, particularly for ESSs cooperating with solar photovoltaic (PV) or wind farms, using a stochastic unit commitment (UC) model co-optimizing energy and reserves by the ESSs with the enhanced deliverability of deployed reserves. For benefit measurements, cost savings, renewable energy generation improvements, and carbon dioxide emissions reduction are quantified and compared under the different operational conditions of ESSs. Optimal UC, energy, and upward & downward reserve schedules by the thermal generators and ESSs are provided by the proposed simulation model. The model is also designed to achieve environmental policy goals: 30% renewable energy generation and capped carbon dioxide emissions for low-carbon electricity generation. The uncertainties of renewable resources-available wind and solar DNI-and electric load are modeled as random variables, and two-stage stochastic mixed integer linear programming is applied to represent the given uncertainties in the formulation. Scenarios for random variables are generated using the autoregressive-to-anything (ARTA) process.

This goal has its source in several justifications. The first is the need to meet the social and housing needs of households. The second is fuel poverty (energy poverty), including heat (thermal) poverty in Polish households, the natural result of which is the phenomenon of near-ground emissions, being a measure of the level of energy and climate security in local and national terms. The third is the impact of near-ground emissions on the standard of climate safety, as expressed in environmental pollution (of air, soil and water). The fourth is the use of geothermal energy as a significant thermal energy potential which makes it possible to significantly reduce the phenomenon of near-ground emissions and their consequences in terms of energy and climate security. The topics of research addressed in the article will focus on three issues: defining near-ground emissions and their constituent factors; explaining the impact of near-ground emissions on the quality of the natural environment and infrastructure, and showing to what extent geothermal energy can be an important source of heat in combating near-ground emissions as well as responding to the energy and climate security strategy policy.

The empirical part of the work uses quantitative and qualitative research methods in order to examine (determine) the magnitude of household heat poverty which leads to near-ground emissions, as well as to determine the temporal and spatial characteristics of atmospheric air pollution.

The scenarios show that smart EVs are a promising flexibility technology for the energy system and can be one of the most cost-effective flexibility options under the right regulatory and user-specific conditions.

This paper addresses the hybridization of the micronuclear reactor and Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) Energy Sources (RESs) to develop a flexible, cost-effective, sustainable, and resilient off-grid Hybrid Energy System (HES). The paper presents three types of hybridization methods, termed “Direct Coupling,” “Single Resource and Multiple products-based Coupling,” and “Multiple Resources and Multiple products-based Coupling.” The hybridization techniques are used to plan and identify the most efficient Nuclear-Renewable Micro-Hybrid Energy System (N-R MHES). The sizing, performance, and characterization of N-R MHES solely depend on the RES and load characteristics' availability. Based on proposed hybridization techniques, mathematical modeling of N-R MHES's economy is carried out in the MATLAB environment. An artificial intelligence optimization algorithm, namely Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), is used to minimize the Net Present Cost (NPC) and achieve the optimal system configurations of different N-R MHESs. The simulation results determine that “Multiple Resources and Multiple Products-based N-R MHES” provides around 1.8 times and 1.3 times lower NPC than “Single Resource and Multiple products-based Coupling” and “Multiple Resources and Multiple products-based Coupling,” respectively, with an acceptable margin of reliability.

The main objective of this paper is to develop an integrated energy planning (IEP) framework for Ghana as a guideline for addressing energy challenges, to promote energy efficiency in both demand and transmission, CO2 emissions reduction, and the utilization of renewable energy sources (RES). The methods used are content analysis, multiple case study, and procedure for IEP framework development. The primary computer tool used for the analysis and future energy projections was Long-range Energy Alternative Planning. The demand forecast was performed using key input parameters, including Gross Domestic Product, population change and urbanization. The overall results of this study suggest 40% of non-conventional renewable energy resources into the country's energy mix, proposed energy efficiency promotion in both demand and transmission, and the utilization of RES integration to save the nation up to about 40% CO2 emissions reduction. The paper recommends strategies to reduce losses in the transmission and distribution systems of Ghana. The paper again recommends the revenues accrued from the carbon tax for maintenance work on the existing equipment, and finally, an integrated energy planning framework was developed to serve as a roadmap for Ghana's energy sector up to the year 2050.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3018314","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9172048","CO₂ emissions;energy demand;energy efficiency;energy policy;installed capacity;integrated energy planning;renewable energy sources","Renewable energy sources;Planning;Guidelines;Reliability;Sociology;Statistics;Production","","12","","69","CCBY","20 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Through case studies we demonstrate that an EV with vehicle to grid (V2G) capability can reduce system costs in a future GB electricity grid by up to £12,000 per year, and reduce CO2 emissions by 60 tonnes per year, mainly due to reduced curtailment of wind power. The paper also quantifies the changes in the benefits of fleet V2G resulting from variations in FR delivery time, the penetration of wind or the uptake of alternative flexibility providers. Finally, a battery degradation model dependent on an EV's state of charge is proposed and implemented in the stochastic scheduling problem.

Due to the robust peak shaving and energy storage capabilities of pumped storage hydropower (PSH), PSH and tiered carbon trading can be employed to address these issues. However, there are scarce reports on research exploring the integration of PSH and carbon trading into CHP systems. To fill the technology gap, we propose a low-carbon optimal scheduling method that integrates hydropower-wind-PV-thermal-battery (HWPTB) with CHP. The scheduling model for coordinated multi-energy complementarity of HWPTB is developed to address the electric and heat demand of users. The proposed work is validated by numerical simulation, compared with the traditional optimal scheduling method without considering PSH and carbon trading, the wind and PV power curtailment rates are reduced by 7.17% and 6.77%, respectively, and the operation cost is also reduced by 43.6%, and the CE cost is -4163.3 ( ${\$}$ ).

Furthermore, optimal integration of these RESs make this task more challenging because of their intermittent nature. Therefore, in the present study power flow problem is treated as a multi-constraint, multi-objective optimal power flow (MOOPF) problem along with optimal integration of RESs. Whereas, the objectives of MOOPF are threefold: overall generation cost, real power loss of system and carbon emission reduction of thermal sources. In this work, a computationally efficient technique is presented to find the most feasible values of different control variables of the power system having distributed RESs. Whereas, the constraint satisfaction is achieved by using penalty function approach (PFA) and to further develop true Pareto front (PF), Pareto dominance method is used to categorize Pareto dominate solution. Moreover, to deal with intermittent nature of RES, probability density function (PDF) and stochastic power models of RES are used to calculate available power from RESs. Since, objectives of the MOOPF problem are conflicting in nature, after having the set of non-dominating solutions fuzzy membership function (FMF) approach has been used to extract the best compromise solution (BCS). To test the validity of developed technique, the IEEE-30 bus system has been modified with integration of RESs and final optimization problem is solved by using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm.

While these sources have accompanied in a gathering of advantages, such as cost-effective operation of wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) installations and the mitigation of environmental hazards linked with traditional power sources, they have also introduced a host of challenges to planning and operation of power systems. Also, Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) stand out as a highly promising technology for reducing carbon emissions in the transportation sector, aligning with the global Net-zero target. The standard optimal power flow (OPF) problem, which is naturally nonlinear, has become even more complex with the addition of renewable energy sources and plug-in electric vehicles along with traditional thermal power generators. This increased complexity comes from the unpredictable and intermittent nature of these new resources. Monte Carlo techniques are used to estimate the production costs of renewable energy sources and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and analyze their viability. The uncertainty of the renewable sources and PEVs is modeled using Weibull, lognormal, and normal probability distribution functions (PDFs). The comprehensive OPF, incorporating renewable energy components and PEVs, is cast as a single objective problem encompassing various objectives, such as decreasing fuel costs, total emissions, voltage deviations, and real transmission losses. This research shares a common objective by introducing a novel hybrid metaheuristic optimization algorithm (MRGTO) to address the OPF challenge. Additionally, the study explores the impact of renewable energy resources and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) on the stochastic OPF problem. The MRGTO employs artificial gorilla troops optimizer (GTO) with manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO) algorithm to achieve the optimal results for the OPF problem with stochastic RES and V2G. The developed technique is expected to increase the solution accuracy through increasing the solution diversity through an optimization procedure. Initial assessments are executed on benchmark functions. After that, a combined model of wind and PV-integrated IEEE 30-bus system are executed by the proposed MRGTO algorithm and other well-known optimization algorithms. Additionally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is assessed using the IEEE 30-bus test system under different scenarios. The evaluations have shown the proposed MRGTO technique to be superior at attainment a best solution for the OPF problem considering stochastic wind and PV power and V2G. Moreover, the obtained solutions confirmed the MRGTO technique would be more effective in optimization with quicker convergence rate, and higher convergence precision. After testing, the effectiveness of the MRGTO algorithm has been found to be much robust than the conventional artificial gorilla troops optimizer, manta ray foraging optimization, and other well-known published heuristics, metaheuristics, and hybrid optimization techniques.INDEX TERMS Optimal power flow, plug-in electric vehicle, renewable energy sources, V2G, artificial gorilla troops optimizer, manta ray foraging optimization.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3425754","Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University (PSAU); SDG Roadmap Research Funding Program project(grant numbers:PSAU-2023-SDG-16); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10589639","Optimal power flow;plug-in electric vehicle;renewable energy sources;V2G;artificial gorilla troops optimizer;manta ray foraging optimization","Optimization;Renewable energy sources;Uncertainty;Costs;Vehicle-to-grid;Power system dynamics;Metaheuristics","","","","52","CCBYNCND","9 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While traditional thermal power plants generate electricity, they are both harmful and inefficient. In this study, battery depth of discharge (DOD) is evaluated for four different battery technologies in the context of the cement industry. The battery technologies evaluated are lead-acid (LA), lithium-ion (Li-ion), vanadium redox (VR), and nickel-iron (Ni-Fe). Five cement plants in Pakistan are considered, including Askari Cement Plant, Wah (ACPW), Bestway Cement Plant, Kalar Kahar (BCPKK), Bestway Cement Plant, Farooqia (BCPF), Bestway Cement Plant, Hattar (BCPH), and DG Cement Plant, Chakwal (DGCPC).

HEGM-1 combines a diesel generator, photovoltaic system, converter, and battery system, while HEGM-2 consists of a photovoltaic system, converter, and battery system. HEGM-3 is a grid-connected version of HEGM-1 and HEGM-4 is the grid-connected version of HEGM-2. A reference base model using only grid connection is also considered. A multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was performed using a cumulative objective function (COF) that includes net present cost (NPC), levelized cost of energy (LCOE), and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The main objective was to maximize COF while minimizing NPC, LCOE, and GHG emissions using optimal battery technology and DOD. The results indicate that VR is the most optimal battery technology, with a DOD of 10% achieved in DGCPC using HEGM-3.

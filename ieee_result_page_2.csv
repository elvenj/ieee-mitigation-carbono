Considering that all thermal power plants under construction are put into operation, and the subsequent thermal power plants can not be put into operation as planned, combined with the current limited factors of UHVDC capacity, this paper proposes a scheme from two aspects of controlling the transient overvoltage level and ensuring the collection of DC power, so as to improve the UHVDC transmission capacity. The research shows that the scheme of installing a condenser in the converter station is recommended, which can improve the DC transmission capacity to full power operation, and has no impact on the supply and demand situation in the province and the grid structure at the sending end. “New energy + energy storage + distributed condenser” is recommended to meet the demand of DC power.

To limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, carbon neutrality becomes a challenge issue worldwide. In 2021, Thailand's Prime Minister pledged at COP26 in Glasgow that Thailand aims at carbon neutrality by 2050, and net zero emissions by 2065. The CO2 emission reduction in the power sector is a significant issue to develop a decarbonized power system. The objective of this study is to analyze energy system in Thailand's power sector toward carbon neutrality 2050 by using Thailand AIM/Enduse model. This study formulates business-as-usual (BAU) and three different carbon neutrality scenarios (CN2050). These CN2050 scenarios are formulated within Thailand context by considering the global CO2 emission trajectories obtained from the integrated assessment models (IAMs) under the different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), namely SSP1, SSP2 and SSP4 scenarios for the representative concentration pathway (RCP) of 1.9 watts W/m2. Most of the CO2 emissions in the energy sector are contributed by the fossil fuel combustion for electricity generation. The power sector contributed more than 40% of the CO2 emission in the energy sector. The CO2 emissions in the power sector are found increasing from 93 MtCO2 in 2010 to 142 MtCO2 in 2030 and 223 MtCO2 in 2050 in the BAU scenario, with AAGR of 2.2% annually. To achieve the carbon neutrality target, the decarbonization in the power generation are the main pillar to reduce the CO2 emission. The CO2 emissions in the power sector are estimated to be reduced by 53%-89% in the CN2050 in 2030 compared to the BAU scenario. In 2050, the CO2 emissions in the power sector are estimated to be zero in the CN2050 scenario. The improvement of energy efficiency, the penetration of renewable energies, and carbon capture and storage (CCS) deployment including fossil fuel based with both CCS and bioenergy with CCS provide a positive effect on CO2 emissions reduction over the period 2010–2050.","","979-8-3503-3326-8","10.1109/ICUE55325.2022.10113547","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10113547","Decarbonized power sector;Paris agreement;Thailand;Carbon neutrality;AIM/Enduse","Renewable energy sources;Limiting;Low-carbon economy;Carbon neutral;Global warming;Fossil fuels;Energy efficiency;Climate change","","","","22","IEEE","4 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper introduces a mathematical approach to compute the marginal emissions factor at a quarter-hourly resolution. The method relies on readily available average emissions factors derived from the generation schedule and corresponding fuel mix. Leveraging publicly accessible datasets from the Irish transmission system operator's data portal, the approach incorporates historical mean carbon intensity time series and system generation data. Our findings reveal that even minor fluctuations in demand could lead to significant increases in marginal carbon emissions, contingent upon the system's conditions concerning variations in renewable generation and interconnector flow. By quantifying these relationships, policymakers and stakeholders gain valuable insights for optimizing climate change mitigation strategies.","","979-8-3503-1683-4","10.1109/UPEC57427.2023.10294836","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10294836","carbon intensity;marginal emissions factor;generation mix;carbon reduction","Renewable energy sources;Climate change;Schedules;Power engineering;Fluctuations;Time series analysis;Government","","","","9","IEEE","1 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When coupled with a thermal power plant, it has the ability to prevent a large amount of CO2 from being released into the atmosphere. However, this technology is associated with a reduction in the efficiency of the power plant it is paired with. As a general rule, the higher the capture rate of CO2, the less effective the plant is. As it is a recent application, it is still possible to reduce the penalty associated with its use. Therefore, it becomes very important to model the thermal power plant associated with this process as accurately and quickly as possible. This work focuses on the boiler of such a plant. Based on experimental data, it aims to assess the feasibility of modeling the boiler of a CCS-coupled coal-fired power plant using a traditional statistical time-series method (ARIMA), a state-of-the-art artificial neural network (ANN) structure, and a hybrid model that combines the previous algorithms. The ANN hyperparameters are optimized using a Tree-structured Parzen Estimators approach. Using different optimization intervals, different sets of hyperparameters are chosen to produce different models. The results showed that the ANN outperformed the ARIMA method by 18%, however, the optimization time outweighed the positive improvement. The ARIMA-based forecasts had an error of only about 1% sMAPE, which is a satisfying value. The combination of the ANN and ARIMA methods using a simple average produced a model that was 18 % better than the best “single” algorithm used.","2161-4407","978-1-6654-8867-9","10.1109/IJCNN54540.2023.10191299","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10191299","","Atmosphere;Artificial neural networks;Boilers;Data models;Hybrid power systems;Global warming;Carbon capture and storage;Climate change","","","","30","IEEE","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper started from the study of regional carbon peaking models at provincial and municipal levels, and studied the current situation of regional carbon peaking based on the improved STIRPAT model. We analyzed the indicators and factors that affect the regional carbon peak and derived the influence of different factors on carbon emissions under different sectors. Taking Hubei province as an example, a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches are used to model and analyze the overall carbon emissions and the carbon emissions of each sector in Hubei province. The analysis of model prediction results will identify areas and sectors with high emissions and a high potential for carbon reduction.

By utilizing regional residual electricity and local power generation to calculate carbon emissions, the actual carbon emission status of the regional power system can be accurately and comprehensively assessed. This supports the formulation of climate change mitigation policies and the promotion of green energy capacity. This paper initially constructed a graph data model integrating the power grid and carbon emission models based on a graph database. Subsequently, through the quantitative comparison of power generation and load in the regional power grid, the grid was categorized into three types: power output region, power input region, and power self-balancing region. Following this, a calculation method for the residual carbon emission intensity in regional power grids considering green energy transactions was proposed for each type of regional power grid. This addressed the deficiency in the current accounting methods for residual carbon in regional power systems when considering scenarios involving green energy transactions. Finally, using the provincial-level power grids as target regions, simulation data for a trading cycle with green energy was employed to calculate residual carbon emission intensity.

It can also be observed that there has been a significant penetration of Hybrid Electric Vehicles from many manufacturers in recent days. Though these BEVs and HEVs are claimed to reduce the GHG emissions one has to pay extra money to buy them over conventional ICEVs. So, there is a need to investigate the amount of reduction of GHG emissions and the worthiness of spending the extra money. In this study, we decided to estimate the life cycle GHG emissions of all the 157 vehicle models currently available in India and analyze whether BEVs and HEVs make a real impact in emission reduction. The life cycle GHG emissions include the emissions from the vehicle life cycle and fuel life cycle. The results obtained showed an interesting fact that GHG emissions by BEVs and HEVs are more than ICEVs with a life span travel distance of 80,000 km for all the vehicle–fuel categories. So, one can choose or deny buying an alternate fuel source vehicle depending on their lifetime travel distance.","","979-8-3503-8465-9","10.1109/TEMSCON-ASPAC59527.2023.10531388","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10531388","Life Cycle Analysis;GHG emissions;Global Warming Potential;Well to Tank;Tank to Wheel;Battery Electric Vehicle;Hybrid Electric Vehicle","Life cycle assessment;Analytical models;Engineering management;Internal combustion engines;Companies;Fuels;Automobiles","","","","16","IEEE","21 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Second, from the perspective of economic performance, BM and NM may be the unique equilibrium mechanisms, depending on the unit and total carbon quotas. Third, to tradeoff the environment and economic performance, BM is the optimal mechanism in the long term to obtain a win-win-win outcome for the renewable energy investment, the electricity generator and retailer, and consumer surplus. Although GM always hurts the electricity retailer and consumer surplus under any situation, the electricity generator may be beneficial, and the total carbon emission is also the least.

However, the origin of the biomass (the regional plantation) used during the combustion, dictates the physicochemical properties of this solid residue, making it suitable for specific applications while rendering it less favourable for others. In this study, a nanoporous zeolite as a CO2 adsorbent has been synthesised from industrial-grade biomass combustion fly ash generated in one of the largest biomass combustion power plants in the UK. The method of nanoporous zeolite synthesis follows a fusion-assisted hydrothermal procedure and the produced nanoporous zeolite has been characterised by X-ray diffraction.

Solar power offers a clean,renewable,and eco-friendly solution. Yet,standalone solar systems are limited by seasonal variations. To counter this,integrated grid systems combining solar and conventional energy are being embraced. Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL) estimates that utilizing solar energy from rooftops in Bangladesh's ready-made garments (RMG) and textile sector could yield 5000 MW. With over 7000 RMG factories and textile plants boasting ample rooftop space,about 400 MW could be generated using solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Although Bangladesh's total renewable capacity is 649.72 MW (2.93% of the total),mainly from solar home systems,the proposed rooftop initiatives promise reduced costs,heightened sustainability,and efficient space utilization. The paper presents the design and financial analysis of a major textile factory,unveiling substantial power usage and costs. It suggests a system of an average of 2,657,933 units per year resulting in a yearly saving in the electricity bill. The expected payback period is 4 years.

To achieve this goal, the industry is increasingly integrating renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, into its expansion planning. However, the effectiveness of these sources varies considerably depending on the location. To minimize carbon emissions and costs, a study was conducted to develop a framework to solve the emission-constrained generation expansion problem using the GAMS optimization tool. This model incorporated a site dependent exploration of renewable energy sources, specifically solar and wind power potential of Pakistan. The study compared the carbon emission results with the base case that did not consider the site dependent Renewable Energy Sources and found that incorporating site-specific Renewable Energy Sources significantly reduced carbon emissions. The research highlights the importance of site-specific selection of renewable energy sources to ensure efficient deployment of renewable energy sources across different locations. It also provides valuable insights into the potential of renewable energy sources to reduce carbon emissions in the electrical power industry. By prioritizing site-specific renewable energy sources, power system planners can effectively incorporate renewable energy sources into their expansion plans to reduce carbon emissions.

Therefore, it is urgent to solve how to reduce carbon emissions of the entire system by optimizing the charging load of new energy vehicles. A low carbon optimization method for the coupling network of transportation network and power grid is proposed. First, the driving and charging behaviours of new energy vehicles are modelled to obtain the operating load of the energy supply station, and then carbon emissions are traced and tracked according to the optimal power flow results of the power grid. Then, an optimization solution framework and method based on the simulated annealing algorithm are proposed. Under the premise of not sacrificing the original charging or hydrogenation needs of users, only the spatiotemporal distribution of energy supply load is transferred. Part of the power originally borne by thermal power is transferred to new energy generation, which improves the local consumption of new energy while reducing the total carbon emissions of the entire coupling network.

In the field of electric power systems, the introduction of renewable energy power generation facilities centered on photovoltaic power generation is being promoted in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, if these power generation facilities are introduced excessively, a duck curve phenomenon occurs in which the operating efficiency of the thermal power generator is poor. Currently, we are reducing the output of photovoltaic power generation equipment to avoid the duck curve phenomenon. In order to suppress the output, it is not possible to further install renewable energy power generation equipment, and the limit of introduction comes with a fixed amount. Therefore, this paper proposes a new load demand control method that improves the duck curve phenomenon without hindering the introduction of renewable energy power generation equipment. In addition, in order to make the proposed method more active, the usual unit commitment has a time interval of 1 hour, but at the same time, we also devised a time interval of 30 minutes.

These challenges arise due to modified network topologies, limited fault current contribution, and bidirectional power flows. The low fault current contribution of inverter-based resources is due to the thermal constraints of converter switches. The reduction in current contribution from inverter-based sources causes the maloperation of conventional over-current relaying schemes in the distribution system. Also, the varying load levels limit the operation of conventional voltage-restrained relays. In this paper, a new methodology is developed to mitigate the issues of existing over-current relays (OCRs). This approach uses local positive sequence current and voltage to modify the pickup current of the relay and makes it adaptive to different loading conditions. In this work, the SPV plant model is operated in voltage control mode where the SPV plant complies with grid codes, i.e., the fault ride-through (FRT) condition.

To realize emission reduction, distributed energy resources (DERs), such as rooftop photovoltaics (PVs), are developing rapidly. To accommodate numerous emerging DERs, local energy systems (LES) and peer-to-peer (P2P) trading have aroused more and more attention. In this article, a P2P energy trading model is proposed to enable LESs to accommodate numerous emerging DERs and to reduce carbon emissions from the power sector by considering the emission obligation on the demand side. In the proposed distributed transaction framework, it is pointed out that demands are the underlying driver of carbon emissions. Therefore, a double taxation mechanism is considered. Free quotas are allocated to the prosumers on the demand side. If the indirect emission of the consumer exceeds the allocated free quotas, it has to purchase additional carbon emission rights (CERs) in a local integrated carbon and electricity market. First, an energy dispatch model in the distribution system is proposed to solve the power flow. Second, based on the power flow, the carbon emission flow model is utilized to track the emission from the generation side to the demand side. Third, CER trading is then integrated into the P2P trading model to encourage local transactions between prosumers. The formulated problem is solved through a distributed optimization algorithm to enhance the computation efficiency and protect the private information of prosumers. The proposed framework and methodology are verified in case studies.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2023.3298889","Australian Research Council Research Hub(grant numbers:IH180100020); ARC Training Centre(grant numbers:IC200100023); ARC Linkage(grant numbers:LP200100056,ARC DP220103881); Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71931003,72061147004); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:72171206); Shenzhen Key Lab of Crowd Intelligence Empowered Low-Carbon Energy Network(grant numbers:ZDSYS20220606100601002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10210332","Carbon emission flow (CEF);carbon emission right (CER) trading;double taxation mechanism;peer-to-peer (P2P) trading","Carbon dioxide;Mathematical models;Emissions trading;Generators;Costs;Peer-to-peer computing;Renewable energy sources","","5","","33","IEEE","7 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, the TC-MOGEP problem is formulated based on AC-power flow analysis and considering presence of variable/intermittent Renewable Energy Sources (vRES). vRES related constraints in terms of resource availability and variability are considered to ensure reliability and security of supply. The paper studies the dynamics brought about by inclusion of both AC-power flow analysis and vRES in TC-GEP optimization. When considering AC power flow constraints, feasible TC-GEP results were achieved up to the fourth year of optimization (45MW). Beyond this load, no feasible solutions could be obtained even with increased investment in generation sources due to divergence of the AC-based power flow analysis. The divergence was caused by unsatisfied constraints majorly overloading of existing transmission lines. Though penetration of vRES in the optimized expansion plans slightly increased the generation investment cost by 2.5% it significantly reduced the operational cost by approximately 50% resulting to an overall cost reduction of up to 19%. Using the proposed formulation and solution methodology a 6.5% and 4.5% annual average share of vRES were realized in installed capacity and energy mix respectively. This penetration level resulted to a 55% reduction in CO2 emissions.","2153-0033","979-8-3503-3621-4","10.1109/AFRICON55910.2023.10293579","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10293579","Generation Expansion Planning;Intermittent/ Variable Renewable Energy Sources;AC Power Flow","Renewable energy sources;Costs;Power transmission lines;Metaheuristics;Planning;Reliability;Security","","","","22","IEEE","31 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An economic approach is to devise a solution for increasing the penetration of renewable energy sources. This can be achieved by implementing taxes on CO2 emissions from fossil fuel power plants (FFPP). However, it is important to carefully design this tax to ensure that sustainability is not compromised. For instance incorrect tax amounts and implementation methods can result in an excessive increase in energy prices and a reduction in consumption. This paper proposes the power system sustainability index (PSSI), which incorporates economic, social and environmental aspects to obtain optimal tax. Furthermore, tax revenue is allocated as a subsidy to wind power plants (WPP). The mutual effects of taxation, prices and subsidies create a loop, wherein the amount paid as a subsidy and received as tax converge in an optimized cycle. Thus, the proposed optimized carbon tax-subsidy mechanism (OCTSM) has two key characteristics: it increases the PSSI optimally and ensures equivalence between the amounts paid and received. The effectiveness of the developed strategy was evaluated on the modified IEEE 24-bus test system with penetration of WPP along with power production uncertainties. The results indicate that an optimized tax system leads to a higher PSSI. Furthermore, as the total installed capacity of WPP increases, the impact of the tax on improving the PSSI becomes even more significant. However, there is a limit to the capacity expansion, beyond which the effect on the PSSI diminishes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3406632","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10540032","Carbon tax;energy policy;power system sustainability;tax-subsidy mechanism;wind power penetration","Finance;Carbon tax;Power generation;Wind power generation;Carbon dioxide;Fossil fuels;Costs;Energy management;Government policies;Sustainable development;Indexes","","1","","42","CCBY","28 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, they tend to overlook the potential long-term advantages associated with low-carbon dispatch. This study presents an innovative framework that integrates the equilibrium-based traffic assignment problem with low-carbon demand response methods. The solving of the traffic assignment problem yields the optimal decision for charging and route choices for electric vehicle users. The interdependence of user choices leads to the establishment of a game equilibrium state. Social managers utilize local marginal emission to efficiently regulate the efficient flow of traffic within transportation network (TN), which is tightly connected to the charging load, with the help of implementing EVCS charging prices and road tolls. The presented example outcomes illustrate the efficacy of the algorithm and highlight the balance between carbon reduction and economic considerations. Simultaneously, empirical evidence demonstrates that the manipulation of charging prices and road toll adjustments exerts a substantial influence on the traffic flow. Consequently, it becomes imperative to engage in collaborative decision-making that integrates both networks in order to effectively address this issue.","","979-8-3503-4509-4","10.1109/EI259745.2023.10512838","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10512838","Electric vehicles charging station;coupled power and transportation network;low carbon demand response;deep reinforcement learning","Electric potential;Roads;Computational modeling;Transportation;Carbon dioxide;Transforms;Electric vehicles","","","","10","IEEE","9 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The results show that adequate carbon pricing is an effective measure to reach significant emission reductions with in the power sector through fuel switching from coal to gas. Moreover, the impact of the fuel-switch on emission reductions is highly dependent on the initial relationship of fuel prices for gas and coal given low carbon prices. Conversely the dependency decreases with higher carbon prices. Overall, the marginal benefit of ambitious carbon prices is capped by the capacity utilization of gas-fired power plants.

However, the major problem of Renewable energy is its poor reliability and limited availability. To increase the reliability of Renewable Energy, many methods have been suggested and implemented in the sector. In this paper, we have suggested the use of repurposed EV batteries as Grid Level Energy Storage System to increase the reliability of Renewable Energy plant. Financial analysis of using the repurposed EV Batteries has been done and a Comparative study was done amongst Renewable Energy Plant using new batteries for Energy Storage System, Renewable Energy Plant using repurposed EV Batteries for Energy Storage and a Conventional Coal-fired Thermal power plant. It is observed that used battery storage system is not only economical of the three but also offers many other benefits like lower payback period, avenues for re-using the EV Batteries, etc. With the Government Target of 30 % penetration of EV in the Transport Sector by 2030, market will be abundant with used EV batteries. It is also important for the Indian Grid to take adequate measures promptly to overcome the reliability and availability of Renewable Energy Plants by deploying large scale Grid Level Storage Systems in a phased manner.","","978-1-6654-9175-4","10.1109/IPRECON55716.2022.10059500","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059500","Electric Vehicle;LI-Ion Batteries;Grid Storage;Carbon Emission;FGD (flue gas desulfurization)","Renewable energy sources;Costs;Government;Power system stability;Electric vehicles;Stability analysis;Batteries","","1","","16","IEEE","16 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, Long-Term GEP performed with variable renewable energy (VRE) and emission limitation to achieve Indonesian Government emission reduction target mentioned in RUPTL document. This paper uses the Sulawesi power system as a study case to perform the Long-term GEP. Considering the emission limit in the GEP, the renewable energy mix is increased and meet the Indonesian government’s target for 31% renewable energy mix in 2050. The renewable energy mix increased from 26.57% to 32.39% in 2050. With those energy mixes, the average CO2 emission reduces from 41.96 Mtons to 27.04 Mtons.

Therefore, this paper constructs a robust optimal scheduling model of CCS-P2G virtual power plant taking into account the punitive carbon price. In the model, the penalty carbon price increases the price of excessive carbon emission; the volatility of renewable energy output is included in the robust optimization. The simulation results show that compared with the traditional carbon price, the penalty carbon price has a better carbon reduction effect on VPP; the smaller the robustness index in the robust optimization, the more conservative the system is, and the larger the VPP gain is, and vice versa.

Substitution of traditional overhead lines conductors with innovative ones can play a key role in the reinforcement of transmission and distribution electric grids, allowing at the same time high environmental benefit, as reduction of CO2 emissions. In order to predict accurately economic and environmental savings, it is important to demonstrate that the value of the estimated and calculated ac resistance is almost equal to the ac resistance in operating conditions. The present paper summarizes the variable of interest in the ac resistance evaluation for general stranded bare conductors, then a general ac resistance measurement process is defined and applied, measured values are compared with estimated values computed by means of codes. An approximated evaluation of economic and environmental savings due to the re-conductoring operation is carried out and the actualized costs of the energy losses for traditional and innovative conductors are computed and compared, with the aim to show the benefits of innovative conductors.","","978-1-7281-0653-3","10.1109/EEEIC.2019.8783935","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8783935","Innovative conductors;power losses reduction;ac resistance evaluation;ac resistance measurements","Conductors;Resistance;Temperature measurement;Current measurement;Electrical resistance measurement;Magnetic cores;Voltage measurement","","","","26","IEEE","1 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The consumption rate is estimated to be 25–30 gigatonnes per year. The present study aims to assess the environmental impacts due to the production of concrete in India. In this study, the reduction in impacts is also calculated considering different scenarios specific to India. The impacts were evaluated for 100 m3 of concrete production. A total of five impact categories were considered and four scenarios were accounted for estimating the impacts reduction. The scope included material phase, production phase and end-of-life phases while use phase was not considered. Cement contributed the highest (89%) to the overall environmental impacts due to concrete production in India. The study found that the existing baseline scenario (S 1) was the second most least preferred and the scenario (S2) considering the dismantling and recycling was the least preferred having the highest environmental impacts. The scenario (S4) considering the use of renewable energy had the least impacts on the environment and offered about 9% of impacts reduction in comparison to existing baseline scenario (S 1). This study will help the decision makers and construction companies to reduce the environmental footprint of concrete production.","","979-8-3503-3326-8","10.1109/ICUE55325.2022.10113530","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10113530","Concrete;Environmental Impacts;Impacts Assessment;Life Cycle Assessment;Sustainability","Renewable energy sources;Climate change;Production;Coal;Developing countries;Recycling;Concrete;Product life cycle management;Environmental factors;Sustainable development","","","","18","IEEE","4 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, electricity usage statistics continue to rise, primarily due to fossil fuel power plants. Therefore, the Carbon-Dioxide Renewable Portfolio Standards (CO2RPS) policy is proposed for consumers to address this issue. The policy comprises two parts: increasing the percentage of renewable energy used in buildings and increasing the number of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) required for buildings over 2,000 square meters (1@1 policy). This study presents a scenario after applying the policy, which can serve as a guide for developing infrastructure for electric vehicle (EV) penetration and controlling CO2 emissions. The proposed policy focuses on carbon neutrality by linking the buildings and transportation sectors. The proposed policy can help countries achieve their carbon neutrality and net-zero emissions goals by supplementing the existing Building Energy Code (BEC) policy.","","979-8-3503-1809-8","10.1109/APPEEC57400.2023.10561984","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10561984","carbon neutrality;net-zero emission;energy policy;carbon-dioxide emission portfolio standard;CO2ePS","Renewable energy sources;Net zero;Electricity;Buildings;Transportation;Carbon neutral;Propulsion","","","","25","IEEE","20 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the urgent need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, renewable energy sources become the attractive and optimal solution for different countries and the process of decarbonization takes place. The increase of RES will lead to reducing the system inertia and increasing the rate of change of frequency in the system. The method used to indicate the system inertia in this paper is evaluated by the RoCoF with different renewable penetration and synchronous rotating generators. Sultanate of Oman has set a target to introduce renewable energy resources which will support meeting the demand growth and reducing CO2 emission. This research will test the system inertia of the Dhofar transmission system and define the maximum RES penetration that can be embedded into the system. Different spinning reserves need to overcome the reduction of system inertia by adding new rotating mass to the system and maintaining the minimum level of rotating machines with a safety margin. This paper addresses the different scenarios of RES penetration measuring the system inertia. Finally, the manuscript presents the optimal solution to overcome the reduction of inertia in the Dhofar transmission system.","2163-5145","978-1-6654-8240-0","10.1109/ISIE51582.2022.9831455","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9831455","Renewable Energy;Rotating Mass;Synchronous inertia","Industrial electronics;Renewable energy sources;Production;Low-carbon economy;Carbon dioxide;Wind farms;Generators","","1","","17","IEEE","25 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The surge in PEVs sales placed a significant power demand on the grid infrastructure. This massive demand for power has a negative impact on the efficiency of the distribution system and even result in a power surge. To resolve these problems and ensure a steady supply of power, smart charging management techniques are needed. In addressing the aforementioned challenges, this research introduces a scheduling technique based on multi-objective optimization. The study employs metaheuristic optimization algorithms, specifically Ant Lion Optimization (ALO) and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), to mitigate both charging cost and load variance. To streamline the optimization process, the weighted sum method is employed, converting the original multi-objective problem into a single-objective problem The simulation results demonstrate that compared with uncontrolled charging, smart charging scheme minimizes the cost of charging and network overloading.","","979-8-3503-0473-2","10.1109/STPEC59253.2023.10430715","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10430715","Multi-objective model;PEVs;ALO;GWO","Plug-in electric vehicles;Costs;Power demand;Simulation;Surges;Optimization;Smart charging","","1","","14","IEEE","19 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
